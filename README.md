I have done 3 tasks in the frontend:

1 (simple).  Sidebar collapse functionality (similar to img 1)
Implement "Copy" button on messages in chat (both for code and normal message) (frontend)
Implement ability to remove uploaded avatar of agent (frontend)


I also made a small project to implement a collapsed sidebar and rich text editor, which I misunderstood at first, so please consider it if you like. I am attaching it via this link:
