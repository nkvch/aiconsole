As of now, the latest stable release is React 17.0.2, which was released in March 2021. Here are some of the key updates:\n\n1. **New JSX Transform**: In React 17, there is a new JSX transform, and you can now use JSX without importing React.\n\n2. **Gradual Upgrades**: React 17 introduces the ability to perform gradual React upgrades. When you upgrade from React 15 to 16 (or, this time, from React 16 to 17), you would usually upgrade your whole app at once. This works well for many apps. But it can get increasingly challenging if the codebase was written more than a few years ago and isn\u2019t actively maintained.\n\n3. **Event Delegation Changes**: In React 17, React will no longer attach event handlers at the document level. Instead, it will attach them to the root DOM container where your React tree is rendered.\n\n4. **Effect Cleanup Timing**: In React 17, useEffect cleanup functions run asynchronously by default, and they run right after the screen has been updated.\n\nPlease note that the React team is also working on the upcoming React 18 release. React 18 will include out-of-the-box improvements like automatic batching, new APIs like `startTransition`, and a new streaming server renderer with built-in support for `React.lazy`.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the official React.js blog and GitHub repository regularly.", "requested_format": null, "tool_calls": [], "is_streaming": false}]}], "is_analysis_in_progress": false}
